## Request

Using the language of your choice, write a function that takes as input a JSON string representing an array of objects, and returns a description of the data format. You may assume that when an object property leads to another object, or array of objects, those objects are always of the same type. (In the example, we name that type with an I followed by the property name, with capitalization adjusted.)

We will be looking not only at correctness, but also at how easy the code would be to understand, maintain, and repurpose.

Provide the function, any test inputs you use to test it, and the corresponding test outputs.

## Changes
* 해당 함수의 인자로 JSON string 이외에 Array가 갖는 object들의 interface name이 되는 인자도 받도록 구성

## Test tool
* jest
